# SWEN90004-Modelling-Complex-Software-Systems
Project 1 of the course Modelling Complex System, aiming to implement a concurrent system using Java monitor.
The Scenario Description:
There is a cable car connecting a valley and the terminus, and trains connecting villages. The terminus connects the first village and the last village. A group of tourists will arrive at the valley at random time, the cable car will send the group to the terminus. The group will also be sent from the last village to the terminus then go down to the valley then depart. 
Given that the cable car and the train could only be occupied by one group at the same time, arrive and depart are called by a producer and a consumer at random time. 
This project simulates this scenario and handle the concurrent issue using Java monitor.
